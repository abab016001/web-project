/**
 * # Modules
 * -
 * JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate files.
 * This makes it easier to maintain the code-base.
 * ES Modules rely on the import and export statements.
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * ## Export
 * -
 * You can export a function or variable from any file.
 * Let us create a file named person.js, and fill it with the things we want to export.
 * There are two of exports: Named and Default.
